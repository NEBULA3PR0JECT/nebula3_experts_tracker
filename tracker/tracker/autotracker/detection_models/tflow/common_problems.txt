# Problem #1: 
Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 7.5.1 but source was compiled with: 7.6.4
Solution:

Download your the Cudnn that is suitable for your machine.
In my case it's cuda 10.0, so I download Cuddn 7.6.4 from:
  - Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn  
  - Create an account  
  - Download the suitable version of Cudnn from https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download  
  - Extract the downloaded file `tar -xzvf <filename>`  
  - Copy the following files into the CUDA directory  
In my case it was `cudnn-10.0-linux-x64-v7.6.4.38.tgz`

Then, run the following commands and you are done.

sudo cp -P cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-10.0/include
sudo cp -P cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64/
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64/libcudnn*
